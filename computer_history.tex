\section{INTRODUCTION}
	Through out history there as been thousands of video games released for computers. Video games are a fun hobby that kills time with ease. Video games are apart of everyday life for some people and very few even make a career just playing video games. If your familiar with famous YouTubers like pewdiepie and markiplier who made millions from Youtube just by playing games that they love then you would know what i'm talking about. When I say this that doesn't mean base all of your career goals on YouTube and video games but it is a possiblility. Computer games have come far in this time from games like Elite Dangerous that has a playing field of a 1 to 1 scale of the entire Milky Way galaxy right on your PC. Games are massive now but where did it all start?

\section{TIME PERIOD}

The first computer game to be recognized as a game was
Spacewar! This video game was created by Harvard and MIT
employees, Steve Russell and Wayne Witanen. This game
amongst the other early computer games were first being
developed in the early 50's and 60's. After Spacewar! was
created, there seemed to be a rise of computer games such
as Space Travel and Hamurabi. The game that many people
mistakenly name the first computer game in history is known
as Pong. Pong was created in 1972 by Allan Alcorn. He did 
not create it on his own valition but rather was tasked by
the co-owner of atari at the time, Nolan Bushnell. Since the
early 60's, there have been a plethera of computer games
varying in genre from FPS, RTS, MMO's and many more.
Even today, computer games are still on the rise with the
release of VR gaming and augmented reality gaming such
as Pokemon Go.

\section{COMPUTER HARDWARE}

There have been many ways computer games have been able
to be used on. From Spacewar! originally being created on the
PDP-1 to massive games such as Skyrim on the Xbox One. 
Now, you don't need to have a PC to play video games, but 
you can buy a console to play games on. Companies such as
Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo, have created video game
consoles for people to play games on their t.v. Microsoft
is widely known for its console series known as the Xbox.
Sony is known for the Playstation console, both portable
and stationary. Nintendo has created N64, Gameboy,
DS, and their most popular console, the Wii. If you don't
want to use a console to play and would rather use a PC, for
more fluid gameplay on graphic intensive games, you will need
a good GPU to run them. An example of a great graphics
card is the GTX 1080ti. The GTX 9 and 10 series are known
for being the best cards on the market for a fair price.

Here is a sampling of the best known consoles from the 
largest console producing companies.

\section{COMPUTER SOFTWARE}
	There is many softwares that game developers use to help them make the game that they want to make. Game developers use what they call "game engines", "render engines", "physics engines" that provide them with tools and libraries that take care of some of the tedious stuff for them. It basically keeps them from having to re-invent the wheel so to speak. There are many of these game engines that may sound familiar to you like Unity, which is used for high end game development, Physx, and unreal game engine. Amazon actually made a game engine called lumberyard.

\section{CONCLUSION}
	Games have come a very long way from where they started. They went from 2D pixles being ran on a dinosaur machine( I say this not only because the computers were old but also because they were very big! Its like a double metaphore) to 3D graphics with light shading and 3D physics. Games went from bouncing a ball back and fourth on a single screen to the gameplayer being able to explore an entire galaxy. To this, we can conclude that computer games have come a long way from where they started.
